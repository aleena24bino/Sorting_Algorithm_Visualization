# Sorting_Algorithm_Visualization  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/java/java-original.svg" alt="java logo" width="60" height="60"/>

This project provides a comprehensive visualization of four fundamental sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and Quick Sort. The visualization is implemented using Java, making it an educational tool for understanding how these algorithms work.
- **Insertion Sort Visualization:** Demonstrates the process of building a sorted array one element at a time.
- **Quick Sort Visualization:** Shows the divide-and-conquer approach to sorting by partitioning arrays.
- **Heap Sort Visualization:** Illustrates the process of converting an array into a heap and sorting it.
- **Merge Sort Visualization:** Displays the process of dividing arrays into smaller sub-arrays and merging them back in sorted order.

## How it works?

**1. Overall Structure:**
* The main class Sort6 and its associated helper classes (Arr, Arr_Box, GUI_Display_Arr) form the core of the application.
* Sorting algorithms such as Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort are implemented and visualized through this GUI.

**2.Visualization Setup:**
* Java's Swing framework is used for GUI components (JFrame, JPanel, JButton, etc.).
* Components are organized into panels (input, update_btn, shuffle_btn, output1, output2, etc.) to manage user input, algorithm execution, and displaying results.

**Algorithm Implementation:**
* Each sorting algorithm (insertion(), merge(), quick(), heap()) is encapsulated within methods that perform the sorting logic and update the GUI accordingly.
* For instance, Heap Sort (heap()) initializes a max heap, performs heapification, and repeatedly extracts the maximum element to achieve sorting.

**GUI Interaction:**
* The GUI_Display_Arr class manages the visualization of arrays and tree structures representing sorting algorithms.
* Methods like addArr(), addTree(), warpup(), etc., handle updating the GUI with arrays, tree structures, and text descriptions of algorithm steps.

**User Controls:**
* Buttons (start, stop, previous, next) control the flow of visualization, allowing users to start, stop, and navigate through algorithm steps.
* Input fields (input) accept user-defined arrays for sorting, which are then visualized and processed by the sorting algorithms.

**Execution Flow:**
* When the program starts, users input an array, choose a sorting algorithm, and initiate sorting.
* The GUI updates dynamically to show the current state of the array and algorithm execution step-by-step.
