# Sorting_Algorithm_Visualization  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/java/java-original.svg" alt="java logo" width="60" height="60"/>

This project provides a comprehensive visualization of four fundamental sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and Quick Sort. The visualization is implemented using Java, making it an educational tool for understanding how these algorithms work.
- **Insertion Sort Visualization:** Demonstrates the process of building a sorted array one element at a time.
- **Quick Sort Visualization:** Shows the divide-and-conquer approach to sorting by partitioning arrays.
- **Heap Sort Visualization:** Illustrates the process of converting an array into a heap and sorting it.
- **Merge Sort Visualization:** Displays the process of dividing arrays into smaller sub-arrays and merging them back in sorted order.
